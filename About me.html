            <p class="roles"> I was thrilled to be a finalist at the 16th annual Colloquium from the BCS Chartered Institute for IT.
                The BCSWomen LoveLace Colloquium 2023 had given me insight and a great hands-on experience with regards to presenting.
                I was an 'honourable mention' for the first year category, with my poster about how smartphones can affect the physical
                wellbeings of people, resulting in long term benefits and consequences. 

                This has helped improve my public speaking and enhanced my ability to pick out the key facts that I believe were to be 
                the 'hook and grab' facts.
